v1.0.17b1 - (TBA)
          - PATCH: Thanks to @Wheemer1, he noticed that when hitting (R)estart, that it would overwrite the
            custom mode changes that were originally saved with the default custome mode settings. A new
            function takes care of making sure restarts will now apply any custom mode changes when the
            service/connection restarts.
          - PATCH: Also, thanks to @Wheemer1 for the suggestion to formally add the '--accept-routes'
            commandline argument into TAILMON. A new menuitem (6) under then setup/configuration menu has
            been added that asks whether or not you want to enable this option. Special care needed to be
            taken when this option gets disabled, as a 'tailscale up --reset' command needs to be issued
            before it can be completely disabled without having to endure tailscale warnings.
          - PATCH: Thanks to @rung, added another email notification coming from TAILMON when the router
            was rebooted or manually reset, to indicate that TAILMON has restarted after an unexpected
            router reboot. TAILMON looks at router uptime, and if it's set to automatically start within
            the first 10 minutes of the router coming back up, it will send you an email.

v1.0.14   - (June 8, 2024)
          - PATCH: As noted by a few running older hardware and earller versions of the kernel, they were
            having trouble getting Tailscale to install correctly. This is apparently due to the fact that
            these older devices needed a different installer package. TAILMON now checks for the kernel and
            architecture, and if it matches arm7 with kernel 2.6, then it will install the tailscale_nohf
            package. Uninstall also ensures it will be removing the correctly named package. Huge thanks
            to @ColinTaylor and @jksmurf for helping distill this into a working fix within TAILMON. ;)
          - PATCH: General cleanup and organization throughout the script.

v1.0.12   - (May 23, 2024)
          - PATCH: Added the ability to additionally (R)estart the service/connection under the Operations
            Menu as well as the setup/configuration menu. Instead of having to s(T)op and then (S)tart the
            service, and separately stopping/starting the connection, this will do it all in one swoop. It
            may also help prevent a loss of connection while remote, as stopping anything Tailscale-related
            it typically pretty dangerous, unless you have another way back in.
          - PATCH: Added another menu item under the Setup/Configuration that will allow you to initiate a
            "tailscale up --reset" command. As of recent, with the latest changes being made to the way the
            client functions, it was necessary to issue this command in order for the connection to continue
            operating. While this command can be run manually, it was decided to incorporate this option in
            the TAILMON UI for ease-of-use. Appropriate warning language and further information has been
            added to this item (I) in the Setup/Config menu after running it.

v1.0.10   - (May 12, 2024)
          - PATCH: Made some wording changes based on feedback from @jksmurf in the Operation Mode screen,
            which now explicitly states that changes are made upon exit, and that if the 'Custom' mode is
            selected, that you will be able to make changes to custom settings after TAILMON completes
            making changes.
          - PATCH: Reduced the number of sleep timeouts based on feedback from @snz. This will reduce the
            amount of time you have to receive feedback on what the application is currently doing, but will
            give you the perception that its running faster now. Certain things I do not have control over:
            ie. the time it takes for Tailscale services/connection to stop and start.

v1.0.8    - (May 3, 2024)
          - PATCH: Increased the timer by a few seconds after the Tailscale service is started to hopefully
            reduce any possible error messages you would see when issuing a "tailscale up" command. It's a
            theory that when the service is started and not completely ready to go yet, that when the "up"
            command is given, that this may cause an benign unresponsive tailscale error message, and would
            require a successive "up" command to get it going.
          - PATCH: Included a few more Tailscale folders in the uninstall routine, as the v1.64 version of
            Tailscale adds a couple of different locations where files are being kept. These will all now be
            cleaned up after any uninstall of the Tailscale package.

v1.0.6    - (May 1, 2024)
          - PATCH: The Tailscale binary version is now shown in the UI on the Tailscale Service bar/header.
          - PATCH: The "Custom (O)peration Mode Settings" item in the Operations Menu is now grayed out if the
            "Custom" Operations Mode isn't selected. This item will be non-responsive unless "Custom" has been
            enabled, which will then open the Custom Operation Mode menu, allowing for full control over the
            Tailscale service switches and connection commandline switches.
          - PATCH: A new menu item in the Setup/Configuration menu will now show up if Tailscale has been found
            to be installed. The new option U(P)date will run the "tailscale update" command, and present the
            user with the choice to update to the latest available stable Tailscale version. After the update
            finishes, TAILMON will ask if you would like to reset the Tailscale service/connection (highly
            recommended), as this action will also sync previous switch settings which are wiped out when an
            update is installed.
          - PATCH: Another new menu item under the Custom Configuration menu has been added to provide TAILMON
            with a reboot protection option. Item #6 under this menu will add a command to your post-mount file
            and will launch TAILMON into its own Screen session, providing continued monitoring even after a
            router reboot occurs.

v1.0.2    - (April 30, 2024)
          - PATCH: Thanks to @XIII, for finding an inconsistency that we hadn't stumbled across yet. After an
            install, when running tailmon.sh -setup immediately after resulted in errors showing that it was not
            able to write the .log and .cfg files into their /jffs/addons/tailmon.d folder, because that folder
            gets created upon running tailmon.sh by itself. Emergency fix has been patched! Thanks!

v1.0.1    - (April 29, 2024)
          - PATCH: Straight out of the gate, and @ColinTaylor makes a great observation that the uninstaller is
            still referring to an older Tailscale directory structure that was recently changed. Thanks Colin! This
            has been patched! :)

v1.0.0    - (April 29, 2024)
          - MAJOR: TAILMON is officially released today! Tailscale is a free and open source service, based on
            WireGuard®, that helps users build no-hassle virtual private networks. Once you’ve created a Tailscale
            network (tailnet), you can securely access services and devices on that tailnet from anywhere in the
            world.  TAILMON is a posix shell script that assists with the install, configuration and monitoring of
            Tailscale, running on your Asus-Merlin FW router. Wanted to give huge thanks to @jksmurf for lighting
            this fire… He opened my eyes to Tailscale and its capabilities, and only became natural to want to
            fullfill his wishes to create a formal installer/monitor for this valuable tool for others to enjoy.
            He, along with @Aiadi, @kuki68ster and @ColinTaylor made a fantastic team that has been working
            diligently in the background testing the capabilities, limits and stability of Tailscale on our routers.
            Hats off to all these gentlemen for their help and insight that went into making this tool!
